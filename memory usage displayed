/*Your job is to write a program that shows, in human-readable form (see below for specifics), 
how much memory a set of variables of a certain type will use. Your program should read a character that identifies 
the data type ('i' for int, 's' for short, 'c' for char, 'd' for double). Next it should read an integer that indicates 
how many variables of the given type you wish to store.

Your program should then calculate the amount of memory required to store the given variables. 
Your program needs to be written in such a way that it would also perform correctly on other computers. 
In other words, rather than hard-coding specific sizes for the different variable types, your program needs 
to use the "sizeof()" 
function to determine how much memory an individual variable of a given type needs.*/
